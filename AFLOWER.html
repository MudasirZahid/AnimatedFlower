<div class="title">My Dear Nimra,</div>

<div class="message">
There is something about you that pulls me toward you so strongly — like gravity itself.
It feels like my heart is constantly being drawn closer to you.
Sometimes it feels like I have fallen in love with you all over again, even today.

My heart still holds the same space for you as it always did.
Sometimes I feel insecure about not being where I want to be financially, because I want to give you the best life possible.
I don’t want my current struggles to limit the kind of life I want to build with you.

But no matter what, my feelings for you remain the same — pure, deep, and real.
